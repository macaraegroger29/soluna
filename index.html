        <h2>Happy Anniversary! &#x2665;</h2>
        <p> 
            Hi loveyy, today is our anniversary! I made this website for you to remember our 1 year memories I hope you like it. 
            I just want to thank God for introducing a girl into my life that I cannot believe will last this long with me and 
            accepted me for who I am. Last year, my life did not have colors but he sent me a pretty girl in front of me during 
            our exam named Pauline Nepacina Areola. To start with, I was scared of hurting again because of my imperfections and 
            my cause trouble to you but until now I am happy for us together for celebrating our first anniversary. I'm really 
            grateful for you. I feel better when I'm with you I mean you have a good heart and you're always pretty in my eyes. 
            You listen very well to my story without judgment it's like I am free to say anything I want. The feeling of taking 
            care of by you is like being wrapped in a warm blanket it makes me think less. When you're away I think of you constantly 
            and wait for the day to come to be with you again. I genuinely love you as being yourself and thankful for loving me for 
            who I am as well. I will always take care of you and continue to promise myself to be better to make you happy. You the 
            only one in my heart, he only one who can rearrange my heartbeat, is you. You are the only one who can rewrite my story, 
            the only one who can replace my empty dream is you.
